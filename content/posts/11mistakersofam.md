#### A.	Finch

1.  Projecting profits – It’s easy to treat yesterday’s stats as a projection of your future wealth.

2.	Success in this industry is completely irrelevant unless it is tied to a repeatable process.

3.	Discounting hidden costs – When I assess my campaigns, I always add 5% to the costs.

#### B.	Benjamin Yong

1.	I Didn’t Milk The Campaign While It lasted

2.	Focusing On The Wrong Thing By Thinking Too Big

	- You must learn to WALK before you can RUN.

3.	Not Taking Action

#### C.	Tony Wang

1.	Focusing on short term rather than long term

2.	Not re-investing profits into better technology.

3.	Not focusing on systems.

4.	Not working with other people.

5.	Not hanging out and masterminding with other affiliates IN PERSON.

#### D.	
If you can’t find a suitable partner that is reliable and has the same vision and goals, try joining
or creating masterminds. Expect 80% of these masterminds to fail.

#### E.	
1. The biggest mistakes I made were not capitalizing on untouched opportunities with newly-launched offers as much as I should have and not scaling campaigns as far as I could have while they were hot.

2. Achieve the greatest ROI you possibly can while you can.

#### F.
Not Learning the Mechanics

#### G.
Realizing You’re Not Doing Anything Wrong

#### H.	

So why does one affiliate make $100/day and one $10,000 then?

That affiliate is spending all their time building campaigns and testing new strategies and traffic sources. They are actively building their business by doing actions that are most likely to result in increased revenue.

#### I.	fbQueen

1.	My fear of losing money.

2.	I would focus more on attending networking events.

3.	I would also try partnering up with other affiliates.

#### J.	Malan Darras

1.	The biggest mistake I made was working by myself for so long.

	- Working in Isolation

	- Avoiding paid traffic

	- If you want to make the big money, you have to spend money.

#### K.	Tuan Vy

1.	be a devoted student and consume as much knowledge as possible and constantly develop yourself.

2.	Your pride and ego are two things that will stand in your way of progress.

3.	If you are a newbie, don’t try to be too creative with ideas.  Mimic what is working for others first and learn how to generate conversions.

4.	developing better angles and ideas but this only comes after you have gained some experience.

5.	don’t ever do anything you are unsure about for the sake of being cool.

6.	The competitive nature of this business means only the top 5% who work diligently will rise to the top and actually make real money.This means you must take this craft very seriously.

#### L.attila

Affiliate marketing is all about statistically significant data;

#### M.	
Angles, angles, angles – repeat this to yourself because it’s the secret juice behind a successful campaign.

1. Angles are headlines on banners; text ads and landing pages –

2. it is what make people tick and act.

	- Scaring people with a scary angle;

	- appealing to their wants and desires with a sexy angle;

	- solving their extremely urgent problem with the right solution are all angles.

#### N.	
Split testing, A/B testing, multivariate testing – these are all super important to a successful campaign.

#### O.	
Images are everything on visual traffic sources like Google Display, Facebook – so if I could go back in time; I’d tell myself FOCUS ON IMAGES then the text. The more bizarre, shocking the better.

#### P.	Mr. Green

1.	I was under the impression that every super affiliate knew some super special secret that I didn’t.

	- affiliate marketing was just about applying the basics and working hard.

2.	I wasted time ‘perfecting’every single element of my campaigns before I launched them.

	- The only way your campaign will be perfect is by making decisions based on data you get from traffic, NOT based on your assumptions.

	- Launch your campaigns as fast as possible, let the data do the designing for you.

3.	When I spent $200 on testing and generated $0 revenue I would feel down.

	- You will fail.

	- ou will lose money.

	- You need to be prepared and eager to fail in order to win.

	- Take a lesson out of every campaign you create.

  		(1)	What ad worked best?

  		(2)	What lander worked best?

  		(3)	What targeting worked best?

4. I made decisions without statistically significant data.

	-  I would pause a campaign because I didn’t get a conversion after spending $20 (even though the offer payout was $30).

	-  try to distract yourself with other tasks while data is coming in.

5. I didn’t treat affiliate marketing like a proper business.

	- I also paid $250,000 worth of taxes in my first year because I did business under my personal name

	- Take time to set your business bits and pieces up like company registration,

	- get an accountant etc.

	- Don’t be scared to hire help, you can’t doeverythingyourself.
