#### LandingPage Checklist

A.	

1.	the point of the headline is to get the reader to read the first sentence.

2.	the point of the first sentence is to get them to read the next sentence.

B.	

1.	Here’s my 80/20 tips on copywriting: 1. Focus on benefits first, features later 2. Use “You” and “Your” a lot 3. Use stories to pull your readers in 4. Don’t try to be witty and creative - keep it simple or you’ll lose people 5. Use extreme words to stand out (hardcore, bloody, intense, crazy, insane etc.)

C.	

1.	Lower payout offers will have smaller landing pages (especially on mobile). 99% of the time I’ll have the CTA above the fold (visible as soon as you land on the page). For longer sales pages (higher product offers) your main CTA will likely be at the end of your page.

2.	Test out different copy on your CTA buttons. “Download” might not be the best option. If you’re promoting antivirus software, get creative and try something like “Secure My Phone” or “Destroy Virus Now”. This is a tactic for when you already have a solid landing page and you’re trying to squeeze extra ROI from it.

3.  Use Scarcity To Increase Emotions 

4.	Here are some ways I like to use this tactic: • Countdown timers • Mentioning how long the deal is available for • Saying how few copies are left

D.	Use Authority / Trust Seals 

1.	One thing I learned early on is to give a user only TWO options when they arrive at one of my landers. A. Leave B. Click the CTA to the offer

E.	Tip #15 Reduce Navigation Options

1.	I use GTMetrix.com to test all of my landing pages. Aim to have them load under 500ms for mobile.  The faster the better.

2.	Tip #21 Include Appropriate Scripts Affiliate marketing is a competition, and some industries are a lot more competitive than others. There are Javascript/PHP scripts you can use on your landing pages to help increase CTR, but this is an advanced topic. If you check out some of the popular torrent/adult sites you will see these scripts in action. This is a topic most affiliates don’t talk about publicly as they pay a lot of money to programmers to develop these. There are some examples on forums like STM, but this isn’t something I talk about publicly.

3.	Double Check All Links Before Launch.
